 # General Guidelines 
 
 * Create a branch specific to the issue you're working on, so that you send a PR from that branch instead of the base branch on your fork.
* If youâ€™d like to create a new issue, please go through our issue list first (open as well as closed) and make sure the issues you are reporting do not replicate the existing issues. 
* Have a short description on what has gone wrong (like a root cause analysis and description of the fix), if that information is not already present in the issue.
* If you have issues on multiple pages, report them separately. Do not combine them into a single issue.
